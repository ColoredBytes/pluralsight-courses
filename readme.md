# What is this?


My Job has given me a [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) license to keep on technologies and other stuff. I thought what better way than to make a repo with all the stuff that I do in the class? I am a novice to most of the stuff that will be posted here. So bear with me and if you know of other ways to improve the code reach out.
