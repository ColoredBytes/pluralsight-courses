# Why is this here?

My Job has given me a [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) license to keep on technologies and other stuff. I thought what better way than to make a repo with all the stuff that I do in the class? I'm very new to Python so a lot of this stuff is just noob stuff but hey maybe you'll find something you like.
